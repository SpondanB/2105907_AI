# Genetic Algorithm Image Approximation (p5.js)

## Overview

This project implements a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to iteratively approximate a target image using randomly generated geometric shapes. Inspired by the principles of **natural selection and survival of the fittest**, the system evolves a population of candidate images over successive generations to visually resemble a given input image.

Built using **JavaScript and p5.js**, the project visualizes the evolutionary process in real time, displaying generation count, similarity score, and elapsed time as the algorithm converges.

## How It Works

### Genetic Algorithm Pipeline

The implementation follows the classical five-phase GA structure:

#### 1. Population

* Each individual represents an **image composed of multiple shapes**.
* The population encodes all possible combinations of shapes, colors, positions, and transparency.
* Population size is configurable and balanced to avoid premature convergence or excessive computation.

#### 2. Fitness Function

* Fitness is measured using **pixel-wise similarity** between:

  * The target image
  * The generated image
* Images are converted into pixel arrays, and similarity is computed as a percentage match.
* Higher similarity indicates a fitter individual.

#### 3. Selection

* The top **25% fittest individuals** are selected from each generation.
* This ensures strong candidates propagate while maintaining diversity.
* Prevents domination by a single early-optimal solution.

#### 4. Crossover

* New offspring are generated by **randomly combining attributes** of two selected parents.
* Shape properties such as position, size, and color are inherited stochastically.
* This mimics biological reproduction and recombination.

#### 5. Mutation

To maintain diversity and explore the search space, multiple mutation strategies are applied probabilistically:

* Add or remove shapes
* Modify shape geometry
* Move shape control points (X/Y)
* Change color and alpha values
* Regenerate random shapes
* Reorder shape layers

Mutation is applied using a configurable mutation rate and is essential for convergence.

## Visualization & Output

The canvas displays:

* **Original target image** (reference)
* **Best evolved image** of the current generation
* Live statistics:

  * Generation count
  * Similarity percentage
  * Elapsed execution time

As generations progress:

* ~10% similarity → random abstract shapes
  ![9% similarity](/Output/9.png)
* ~50% similarity → visible structure emerges
  ![51% similarity](/Output/51.png)
* ~75%+ similarity → blurred but recognizable approximation
  ![75% similarity](/Output/75.png)

Further improvement becomes progressively slower due to convergence.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how concepts from **biological evolution** can be effectively translated into computational systems for optimization and creative generation. By carefully balancing population diversity, mutation strategies, and fitness evaluation, the algorithm progressively evolves images that resemble a target input.

While simple in scope, the system highlights both the **power and limitations of genetic algorithms**, especially as convergence slows near optimal solutions. The project serves as a strong foundation for further exploration into evolutionary art, procedural generation, and advanced optimization techniques.
